**ShadowLog** is a Python-based activity monitoring tool built for **cybersecurity education and authorized security testing**.  
It demonstrates how keystroke monitoring, contextual logging, and controlled data transmission operate in **Red Team and Blue Team scenarios**.

Unlike consumer monitoring software, ShadowLog is designed to **teach detection, analysis, and defense techniques**, not surveillance.

## 🚀 Features

- **Keystroke Capture**  
  Logs standard and special keys (Enter, Space, Backspace, etc.).

- **Active Window Tracking**  
  Records the currently focused application to provide context for each log entry.

- **Local Log Storage**  
  Saves logs to disk with automatic file rotation for stability.

- **Optional Remote Logging**  
  Supports sending log batches to a Discord Webhook (disabled by default).

- **Live Control Toggle**  
  Instantly pause or resume logging using a configurable hotkey (`F9`).

## 🧠 How It Works

ShadowLog follows a simple monitoring pipeline:

1. **Hook** – Registers a keyboard listener using system-level hooks.
2. **Context Capture** – Retrieves the active window title during key events.
3. **Log Management** – Writes structured logs locally with rotation support.
4. **Transmission (Optional)** – Sends log batches to a remote endpoint if enabled.

This architecture mirrors real-world monitoring techniques used by both attackers and defenders, making it valuable for **threat modeling and detection research**.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `pip`

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ShadowLog.git

## 🛠️ Usage

> Administrator / root privileges may be required for full keystroke capture.

**Windows**

```powershell
python shadowlog.py
```

**Linux / macOS**

```bash

## 🎛️ Controls

| Action                 | Key        |
